  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a website?",
    answer:
      "Timelines depend on scope — simple landing pages or portfolios take about a week, while full SaaS MVPs or booking apps can take 3–6 weeks. I work in milestones so you can preview progress early.",
  },
  {
    question: "What’s your development process like?",
    answer:
      "I start with discovery (goals, content, design ideas), then wireframing, UI design with Tailwind CSS, and development in Next.js + Supabase. Each phase includes feedback rounds before deployment. I use Sentry and Lighthouse audits to ensure performance and reliability.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle deployment and setup?",
    answer:
      "Yes — I take care of the entire setup: domain, DNS (Cloudflare or Namecheap), SSL, analytics, and hosting on Vercel. I also configure environment variables, email setup, and CI/CD for updates.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you connect my site to tools like Calendly or Stripe?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. I build and integrate booking systems, payment gateways (Stripe, Paystack), chatbots, and calendar syncs (Google or Outlook) to automate your workflow.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you optimize for SEO and performance?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Every site is optimized for speed, accessibility, and SEO — including metadata, sitemaps, and analytics setup (Plausible, GA4). I also remove unused scripts and trackers for cleaner performance.",
  },
  {
    question: "What industries do you work with?",
    answer:
      "I mostly work with small and mid-sized businesses, consultants, and digital creators — helping them launch SaaS products, booking tools, and landing pages that convert visitors into leads.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer ongoing support and updates?",
    answer:
      "Yes — I provide post-launch maintenance, bug fixes, and improvements. You can choose one-time support or a monthly plan that covers uptime checks, backups, and new feature rollouts.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does pricing work?",
    answer:
      "I offer fixed pricing for smaller projects (like landing pages or portfolios) and milestone-based pricing for complex apps. You’ll get a clear quote upfront — no hidden fees.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with my existing website?",
    answer:
      "Definitely. I can refactor, redesign, or optimize your current site. This includes copy cleanup, SEO improvements, tracker removal, and analytics setup.",
