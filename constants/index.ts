  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a website or app?",
    answer:
      "Timelines depend on the project scope — a landing page or portfolio usually takes about a week, while full SaaS dashboards or booking systems can take 3–6 weeks. I deliver in clear milestones, so you can preview and test progress along the way.",
  },
  {
    question: "What’s your development process like?",
    answer:
      "Each project starts with discovery — understanding your goals, audience, and workflow. Then comes design, development, and iteration. You’ll see live previews as we go, and I handle everything from UI to deployment. My process ensures transparency and steady progress from start to launch.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle hosting, deployment, and setup?",
    answer:
      "Yes. I take care of deployment, domain setup, DNS configuration, SSL, and email. Everything is hosted securely (typically on Vercel), with automated backups and monitoring. You’ll get a ready-to-launch product without needing to touch the technical details.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you integrate payments, bookings, or analytics?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. I build and integrate Stripe or Paystack for payments, Google or Outlook calendars for booking systems, and analytics tools like GA4 or Plausible for tracking user behavior — all fully customized to your business needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you optimize for SEO, performance, and accessibility?",
    answer:
      "Yes — every site and app is optimized for speed, SEO, and accessibility. That includes metadata setup, sitemaps, clean code, and Core Web Vitals checks. I also remove unnecessary scripts and trackers for faster load times and better privacy.",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of businesses do you work with?",
    answer:
      "I collaborate with startups, small businesses, and digital brands — helping them build SaaS dashboards, client portals, booking systems, and e-commerce platforms. Whether you’re a founder or an agency, I tailor each solution to fit your goals and workflow.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer ongoing support and maintenance?",
    answer:
      "Yes. I provide ongoing maintenance, feature updates, and bug fixes. You can choose a one-time post-launch package or a monthly support plan that includes uptime monitoring, performance optimization, and security updates.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does pricing work?",
    answer:
      "Smaller projects like landing pages or portfolio sites have fixed pricing. Larger apps — such as SaaS dashboards or booking systems — are milestone-based, with clear deliverables at each stage. Every quote is transparent and tailored to your project’s scope.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you improve my existing website or app?",
    answer:
      "Definitely. I can clean up and optimize your current setup — improving performance, design, SEO, and analytics. Whether it’s a minor refresh or a full rebuild, you’ll get a faster, cleaner, and more effective digital experience.",
